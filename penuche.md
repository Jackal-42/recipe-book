# Penuche
- 1 cup packed light brown sugar
- 8 tbsp butter
- 1/4 cup whole milk
- 2 cups confectioners' sugar
- 1 tsp salt

1. Combine brown sugar, butter, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat until well combined. Simmer but do not boil.
2. Carefully pour in the milk while stirring. Bring to a boil, then remove from heat.
3. Sift the confectioners' sugar into a mixing bowl.
4. Pour the butter mixture over it and mix until completely combined.

The frosting will harden quickly. If it becomes too solid, reheat it in the microwave in 15-second increments
