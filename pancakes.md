# Pancakes
- 1 1/2 cup flour
- 3 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 1/4 cup milk
- 3 Tbsp butter
- 1 Tbsp sugar
- 1 egg
- Splash of vanilla extract
- 1 1/4 cup milk

1. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
2. Soften butter in microwave until it is halfway liquified.
3. Whisk sugar into melted butter. Crack egg into mixture, add vanilla, and whisk extremely well until emulsified.
4. Whisk milk into the butter mixture.
5. Fold butter mixture into dry ingredients. Do *not* overmix. It should be *lumpy*.
6. Turn a pan to medium heat. After it heats up for a minute, rub a stick of butter to cover well. It should brown slightly.
7. Pour pancakes, letting them spread without messing with them. Flip them after bubbles appear on the surface.
