# Chicken And Dumplings
#### Broth
- 6 tbsp butter
- 1 cup chopped onion
- 1 cup chopped carrots
- 1 cup diced celery
- 4 cloves minced garlic
- 3 Tbsp flour
- 1 1/2 cup whole milk
- 32 oz (1 quart) chicken stock
- 4 cups raw chicken
- 1 Tbsp fresh thyme
	- (SUB) 1 tsp dried thyme
- salt and pepper to taste

1. In a large pot, heat oil
2. Add onion, carrot, and celery. Cook for five minutes, until they begin to soften.
3. Add garlic and cook for one minute more.
4. Melt butter in the pot. Add flour and stir to combine, cook for one minute more.
5. Add milk and chicken stock while stirring to ensure proper incorporation. Bring to a boil.
6. Remove chicken and shred, then add back in.
7. Add thyme, black pepper, and salt. Let the broth simmer as you make the dumplings.
#### Dumplings
- 2 cups flour
- 4 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp pepper
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 Tbsp fresh thyme
	- (SUB) 1 tsp dried thyme
- 3/4 cup whole milk
- 4 tbsp melted butter

1. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, pepper, salt, and thyme.
2. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk and melted butter.
3. Stir until a dough ball forms. If it is too dry and will not form, add an extra tablespoon of milk.
4. Using a small cookie scoop (or a spoon), scoop out the dumplings and drop them directly into the simmering broth. Drop them in random locations.
5. Press the dumplings down so that they are immersed in the broth.
6. Place a lid over the pot and lower the heat just enough to keep it simmering. You don't want it to burn on the bottom.
7. Cook for 15 minutes, then cut a dumpling in half to make sure it is cooked. If not, cook for an additional 4 minutes. Serve!
